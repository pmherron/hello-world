This is a change to the readme.txt file
This change was made by the Open Source student Patrick Herron on April 12th.  Patrick is currently enrolled in the Oregon State Computer Science post-bacc program to received his BS in Computer Science.

The file is readme.txt instead of README.md as the repo was used as an extension of the other assignment due this week.
